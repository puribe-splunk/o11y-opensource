## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `haproxy` monitor via the Smart Agent receiver.

This monitors an [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) instance. This monitor requires HAProxy 1.5+.


<!--- SETUP --->
## Socket configuration
The location of the HAProxy socket file is defined in the HAProxy configuration file, as shown in the following example:

```
global
    daemon
    stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock
    stats timeout 2m
```

**Note:** You can use a TCP socket for stats in HAProxy. In your `haproxy` plugin configuration file,
specify the TCP address for the socket. For example, you can use `https://www.example.com/socket:9000`.
In the haproxy.cfg file, change the stats socket to use the same TCP address and port, as
shown in the following example:
```
global
    daemon
    stats socket localhost:9000
    stats timeout 2m
```
To use a more restricted TCP socket, follow these steps:

1. Define a backend server that listens to stats on localhost.
2. Define a frontend proxy server that communicates with the backend server on a different port.
3. Use ACLs on both servers to control access. Depending on how restrictive your socket is, you might need to
add the signalfx-agent user to the haproxy group as follows: `sudo usermod -a -G haproxy signalfx-agent`

The following configuration file shows how to define a backend server and a frontend proxy:

```
global
    daemon
    stats socket localhost:9000
    stats timeout 2m

backend stats-backend
    mode tcp
    server stats-localhost localhost:9000

frontend stats-frontend
    bind *:9001
    default_backend stats-backend
    acl ...
    acl ...
```

<!--- SETUP --->
## SELinux setup

If you have SELinux enabled, create a SELinux policy package by downloading
the [type enforcement
file](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-haproxy/blob/master/selinux/collectd-haproxy.te)
to some place on your server. Run the following commands to create and install
the policy package:
```
    $ checkmodule -M -m -o haproxy.mod haproxy.te
    checkmodule:  loading policy configuration from haproxy.te
    checkmodule:  policy configuration loaded
    checkmodule:  writing binary representation (version 17) to haproxy.mod
    $ semodule_package -o haproxy.pp -m haproxy.mod
    $ sudo semodule -i haproxy.pp
    $ sudo reboot
```

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.


## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing an HAProxy monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: haproxy
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
    smartagent/haproxy:
        type: haproxy
        ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/haproxy` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | no | `integer` |  (**default:** `0`) |
| `proxiesToMonitor` | no | `list of strings` | A list of all the pxname(s) or svname(s) that you want to monitor (e.g. `["http-in", "server1", "backend"]`) |
| `excludedMetrics` | no | `list of strings` | Deprecated.  Please use `datapointsToExclude` on the monitor config block instead. |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

The following metrics are available for this integration:
