## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the Jenkins monitor with the SignalFx Smart Agent receiver. The integration collects metrics from Jenkins instances by hitting the following endpoints:

- Job metrics with the `../api/json` endpoint
- Codahale or Dropwizard JVM metrics with the `metrics/<MetricsKey>/..` endpoint

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

Follow these steps to deploy the integration:

1. Download the Metrics Plugin in Jenkins. For more information, see [Metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics/) on the Jenkins website.
2. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
3. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Jenkins monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/jenkins
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/jenkins:
    type: collectd/jenkins
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/jenkins` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Sample YAML configurations

Sample basic YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
```

Sample YAML configuration with specific enhanced metrics included:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  includeMetrics:
  - "vm.daemon.count"
  - "vm.terminated.count"
```

Sample YAML configuration with all enhanced metrics included:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  enhancedMetrics: true
```
