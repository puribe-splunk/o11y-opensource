## Description

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector provides this integration as the Mesos Marathon monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver. It monitors a Mesos Marathon instance using the [Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/collectd-marathon.md).


## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:
1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Mesos Marathon monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/marathon
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/marathon:
    type: collectd/marathon
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/marathon` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the Mesos Marathon monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Password used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `scheme` | no | `string` | Set to either `http` or `https`. (**default:** `http`) |
| `dcosAuthURL` | no | `string` | The dcos authentication URL which the plugin uses to get authentication tokens from. Set scheme to "https" if operating DC/OS in strict mode and dcosAuthURL to "https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login" (which is the default DNS entry provided by DC/OS) |


The following is a sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: http
```

The following is a sample YAML configuration for DC/OS:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: https
    dcosAuthURL: https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login
```
