You can use detectors to dynamically monitor error rate and latency in the services you are tracing with Splunk APM. APM detectors use built-in algorithms to detect sudden spikes and historical anomalies in your APM metrics or :ref:`Business Workflows <apm-workflows>`.

You can set up an APM detector from the Detector menu on any chart with APM metrics, so that you are alerted about changes in data that matter most to you.

For an overview of detectors in Splunk Observability Cloud, see :ref:`get-started-detectoralert`.

To learn how to set up a detector, see :ref:`create-detectors`. To learn how to view all active detectors in Splunk Observability Cloud, see :ref:`view-detectors`.

The built-in alert conditions for detectors in Splunk APM are slightly different than the set of built-in alert conditions for detectors in Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring. To see the list of built-in alert conditions and their definitions in Splunk APM, see :ref:`alert-conditions-apm`.
