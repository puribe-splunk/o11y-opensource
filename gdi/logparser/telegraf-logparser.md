## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `telegraf/logparser` monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver. This monitor is based on the Telegraf logparser plugin. This monitor tails log files. All metrics emitted from this monitor have the plugin dimension set to `telegraf-logparser`.

##  Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.

2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

## Configuration  

This Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Logparser monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: telegraf/logparser
   ...  # Additional config
```

Here is a sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
 - type: telegraf/logparser
   files:
    - '$file'
   watchMethod: poll       # Specify the file watch method ("inotify" or "poll").
   fromBeginning: true     # Specify to read from the beginning.
   measurementName: test-measurement # This is the metric name prefix.
   patterns:
    - "%{COMMON_LOG_FORMAT}" # Specifies the Apache Common Log Format (CLF).
   timezone: UTC
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/logparser:
    type: telegraf/logparser
    ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

**Note:** Include monitors with event-sending functionality as members of a `logs` pipeline that utilizes an exporter that makes the event submission requests. Use a <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md" target="_blank">Resource Detection processor</a> to ensure that host identity and other useful information is made available as event dimensions.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `files` | **yes** | `list of strings` | Paths to files to be tailed |
| `watchMethod` | no | `string` | Method for watching changes to files ("ionotify" or "poll") (**default:** `poll`) |
