    :description: This is what you need to instrument Java applications for Splunk Observability Cloud.

Meet the following requirements to instrument Java applications for Splunk Observability Cloud:

.. _supported-java-libraries:

Supported libraries and frameworks
=================================================

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java instruments numerous libraries, frameworks, and application servers. For a complete of supported libraries and frameworks, see :new-page:`Supported libraries <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md>` in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

For custom metrics support, you must use MicroMeter 1.5 or higher. See :ref:`java-otel-custom-metrics`.

.. _java-requirements:

Ensure you are using supported Java and JVM versions
==============================================================

The agent of the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java supports the following Java versions:

- Java 8 starting from 8u40 (8u262 for AlwaysOn Profiling)
- Java 11
- Java 17 and higher LTS versions

The following Java Virtual Machines (JMVs) are supported:

- AdoptOpenJDK
- Amazon Corretto
- Azul Zulu
- BellSoft Liberica JDK
- Eclipse Adoptium/Temurin
- Microsoft OpenJDK
- Oracle OpenJDK
- Red Hat OpenJDK
- SAP SapMachine

.. note:: Splunk Observability Cloud officially supports Java and Groovy as JVM languages. You can instrument applications written in other JVM languages, but the quality of the telemetry data is not guaranteed.

.. _java-otel-connector-requirement:

Install and configure the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector
==============================================================

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java exports application and JVM metrics and spans to the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector, which also collects system metric data and logs.

To send application traces and spans to Observability Cloud, install the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for your platform. The following distributions are available:

- Splunk OTel Collector for Linux. See :ref:`otel-install-linux`.
- Splunk OTel Collector for Windows. See :ref:`otel-install-windows`.
- Splunk OTel Collector for Kubernetes. See :ref:`otel-install-k8s`.
