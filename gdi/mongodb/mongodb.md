## Description

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector provides this integration as the MongoDB monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver.

This monitor captures the following metrics about MongoDB:

* memory
* network input/output bytes count
* heap usage
* db connections
* operations count
* active client connections
* queued operations

The plugin also captures the following DB-specific metrics:

* db size
* db counters

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:
1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

If you're monitoring a secured MongoDB deployment, create a MongoDB user with minimal read-only roles, as follows:

```
db.createUser( {
  user: "<username>",
  pwd: "<password>",
  roles: [ { role: "readAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" } ]
});
```

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a MongoDB monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/mongodb
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/mongodb:
    type: collectd/mongodb
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/mongodb` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the MongoDB monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host name/IP address of the Mongo instance |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the Mongo instance (default: 27017) |
| `databases` | **yes** | `list of strings` | Name(s) of database(s) that you would like metrics from. Note: the first database in this list must be "admin", as it is used to perform a `serverStatus()` command. |
| `username` | no | `string` | The MongoDB user to connect as |
| `password` | no | `string` | The password of the above user |
| `useTLS` | no | `bool` | If `true`, will connect to Mongo using TLS (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCerts` | no | `string` | Path to a CA cert that will be used to verify the certificate that Mongo presents (not needed if not using TLS or if Mongo's cert is signed by a globally trusted issuer already installed in the default location on your OS) |
| `tlsClientCert` | no | `string` | Path to a client certificate (not needed unless your Mongo instance requires x509 client verification) |
| `tlsClientKey` | no | `string` | Path to a client certificate key (not needed unless your Mongo instance requires x509 client verification, or if your client cert above has the key included) |
| `tlsClientKeyPassPhrase` | no | `string` | Passphrase for the TLSClientKey above |
| `sendCollectionMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to send collection level metrics or not (**default:** `false`) |
| `sendCollectionTopMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to send collection level top (timing) metrics or not (**default:** `false`) |
