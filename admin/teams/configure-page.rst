   :description: Learn how to view and configure a team landing page.

Every team has an associated landing page that contains information relevant
to team members. A landing page brings together dashboard groups and alerts
triggered by detectors that are linked to the team. The landing page has the
following sections:

* A customizable text section to provide helpful information to team members.
  In this section, you can use Markdown-formatted text.
* A count of active alerts from detectors linked to the team, grouped by severity.
* Links to one or more dashboard groups linked to the team.

Anyone can view the landing page for any team.

The text area identified by the team name contains text and links that provide
documentation for the team and its links. One way to use it is to
describe the teamâ€™s purpose and provide links to relevant wiki pages or runbooks.

The descriptive text supports standard Markdown, including links that use the
following format:

``[link](url)``.

If you're a team member, you can edit the text by following these steps:

#. Click :guilabel:`Edit Description`.
#. Enter your changes in the edit box.
#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

A user with administrative access can edit the text of any team landing page.
