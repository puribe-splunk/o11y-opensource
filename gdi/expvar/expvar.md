## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `expvar` monitor via the Smart Agent receiver.


The `expvar` monitor is a Smart Agent monitor that scrapes metrics from variables exposed in JSON
format at an HTTP endpoint by [expvar](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/). The monitor uses configured paths to get metric and dimension values from fetched JSON objects.

The Metrics section in this document shows metrics derived from expvar variable [`memstats`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/). The memstat variable is exposed by default. These memstat metrics are referred to as standard or default metrics. The configuration examples shown are excerpts limited to the monitor configuration section of the Smart Agent configuration file `agent.yml`.

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.


## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing an expvar monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: expvar
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/expvar:
    type: expvar
    ... # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/expvar` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following tables show the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the expvar endpoint |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the expvar endpoint |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If `true`, the agent will connect to the host using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is `true `and this option is also `true`, the host's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `path` | no | `string` | Path to the expvar endpoint, usually `/debug/vars` (the default). (**default:** `/debug/vars`) |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` | If `true`, sends metrics memstats.alloc, memstats.by_size.size, memstats.by_size.mallocs and memstats.by_size.frees (**default:** `false`) |
| `metrics` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | Metrics configurations |


The **nested** `metrics` configuration object has the following fields:

| Option| Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | no | `string` | Metric name |
| `JSONPath` | **yes** | `string` | JSON path of the metric value |
| `type` | **yes** | `string` | SignalFx metric type. Possible values are "gauge" or "cumulative" |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | Metric dimensions |
| `pathSeparator` | no | `string` | Path separator character of metric value in JSON object (**default:** `.`) |

The **nested** `dimensions` configuration object has the following fields:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` | Dimension name |
| `JSONPath` | no | `string` | JSON path of the dimension value |
| `value` | no | `string` | Dimension value |

## Example configurations

The following example shows the minimum required expvar monitor configuration for exporting
the default metrics from endpoint `http://172.17.0.3:8000/debug/vars`, where `/debug/vars` is the default path:

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
```

You can add the extra dimension `metric_source` with a meaningful value to facilitate
filtering in Splunk Observability Cloud:

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

The following example shows part of a JSON payload containing the exposed variable `requestsPerSecond` containing
requests per second metric information:

```
{
  ...
  "requestsPerSecond": 919,
  ...
}
```

If the payload is emanating from endpoint `http://172.17.0.4:6000/appmetrics`, the monitor can be
configured to scrape the JSONPath value `requestsPerSecond`. The metric name is optional. If not provided,
the default JSONPath value `requests_per_second` is used instead.

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.4
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 6000
  metrics:
    - name: requests.sec
      JSONPath: requestsPerSecond
      type: gauge
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar-aws
```

The expvar monitor can be configured to extract metric values from complex JSON objects such as the one shown
in the following example. Suppose the `memstats` variable shown in the example is exposed at endpoint `http://172.17.0.5:5000/debug/vars`
and you want to extract the cumulative `Mallocs` values.

```
{
  ...
  "memstats": {
                ...
                "GCCPUFraction": 0.0000032707490586459204,
                "BySize": [
                  {
                      "Size": 32,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 35021
                  },
                  {
                      "Size": 48,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 63283
                  }
                ]
                "HeapAlloc": 2138088,
                ...
              }
  ...
}
```

To fetch the first cumulative `Mallocs` value in the `BySize` array, configure the monitor as shown in the following example. The
configured JSONPath contains character delimited keys of metric values in the JSON object. The path must
be defined fully, terminating on primitive values or array of primitive values. The path should not terminate
on embedded objects. If you don't provide a metric name for this configuration, the metric name defaults to
`memstats.by_size.mallocs`. A dimension named `memstats_by_size_index` containing the array index 0 is also
created.

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.0.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

The default path separator character is `.`, so there is no need to specify unless you have a different path separtor character. The following example is the same configuration using `/` as the path separator character:

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats/BySize/0/Mallocs
      pathSeparator: /
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

To fetch all `Mallocs` values or a combination thereof, configure JSONPath with regular expression. The following
configuration configures the monitor to fetch all `Mallocs` values (35387 and 35387). Two data points
for metric `memstats.by_size.mallocs` containing the values will be fetched. The data points will have dimension
`memstats_by_size_index` containing their respective array index. Note that the escape character `\` is used to
escape character `.` of regex `.*` in order take `.` literally as opposed to a path separator character.

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

The following configuration fetches all `BySize` values:

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.\\.*
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

The following configuration also fetches all `BySize` values:

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\d+.\\.*
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

Custom dimensions can be added to metrics, as shown in the following example. The dimension name is required if a dimension
value is provided. The dimension name is optional when the JSONPath for the dimension is provided.

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        name: physical_memory
        value: 4GiB
      - name: app_mem
        value: "10 MiB"
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

The dimension JSONPathcan be configured, as shown in the following example. If the dimension name is not provided, then it is constructed from snake casing the JSONPath. The dimension JSONPath must be shorter than the metric JSONPath
and start at same root. For the following configuration, dimensions `memory_stats` and `memstats_by_size` will
contain values `BySize` and `0` respectively.

```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.0.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        name: memory_stats
        JSONPath: memstats
      - dimensions:
        JSONPath: memstats/BySize
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```

**Note:** Do not configure the monitor for memstats metrics because they are standard metrics provided by default. Memstats is used in this configuration
as an example.

## Metrics

The following metrics are available for this integration: This monitor will also emit by default any metrics that are not listed in the following table.
