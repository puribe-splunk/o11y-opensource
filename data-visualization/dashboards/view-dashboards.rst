      :description: Dashboards are groupings of charts and visualizations of metrics. Observability Cloud has three types of dashboards and dashboard groups: built-in, custom, and user. Built-in dashboard groups are provided by Observability Cloud to give you immediate visibility into the technologies and services being used in your environment. You can also build custom and user dashboard groups to create content specific to your organization's requirements.

This document describes how to view dashboards and dashboard groups, as well as how to adjust your view once you are in a dashboard group or dashboard. It also covers how to create a list of your favorite dashboards for easy access.


.. _viewing-dashboards:

View dashboards and dashboard groups
=======================================

The Dashboards page displays built-in, custom, and user dashboard groups. For more information about these dashboard group types, see :ref:`dashboard-basics`.

To access the Dashboards page, in the navigation menu, click :strong:`Dashboards`.

At the top of the page you can see a list of your :ref:`favorite dashboards<db-favorite>`, your recently viewed dashboards, including any Unsaved dashboards, and the dashboards in your user dashboard group. If you have joined :ref:`teams<admin-manage-teams>` in your organization, a tab for each team also displays.

- To see all the dashboard groups of a particular type, scroll to the dashboard group type section and expand it. Alternatively, you can also click a dashboard group type link in the upper right of the screen. Select from :strong:`Built-in`, :strong:`Custom`, and :strong:`User`.

- To see the list of dashboards in a specific dashboard group, click the dashboard group name.

- To see the list of dashboards in every group, click :strong:`Expand all groups` to the right of the search field.


.. _view-full-screen:

View dashboards in fullscreen mode
=====================================

Observability Cloud offers a fullscreen mode for dashboards. Fullscreen mode is a space-optimized display for displaying your metric data on a TV or other device.

To display a dashboard in fullscreen mode, open the :strong:`Dashboard actions` menu and select :strong:`View Fullscreen`.

To exit fullscreen mode, press the Esc key.

While in fullscreen mode, Observability Cloud resizes available dashboard charts in an attempt to fill the screen based on the maximum number of rows in the dashboard. It also removes any extraneous whitespace and controls typically not needed when the dashboard is passively viewed.

The minimum size allowed for a chart is 160 pixels vertically. For common resolutions, this means the following when in fullscreen mode:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - :strong:`Resolution`
     - :strong:`Maximum rows`
   
   * - 3840 x 2160
     - 13
 
   * - 2560 x 1600
     - 9
      
   * - 2560 x 1440
     - 8
    
   * - 1920 x 1080
     - 6
    
   * - 1440 x 900
     - 5
   
   * - 1280 x 720
     - 4

.. _work-with-charts:

Work with charts on a dashboard
==================================

To resize a chart, click and drag its corners or its left, right, and bottom edges.

To move a chart, click and drag along its top edge.

If you don't have write permissions for the dashboard, or if the dashboard is a built-in dashboard, you must save a copy of the dashboard before you can resize or move its charts. To save a copy, open the :strong:`Dashboard actions` menu and click :strong:`Save as`. To learn more, see :ref:`about-permissions`.

* Share the chart with others. For more information, see :ref:`sharing-a-chart`.

* View information about the chart

* Download an image (screenshot) of the chart

Not all actions are available for all chart types.


View chart data point details
================================

To view information about a data point in a chart in a dashboard, hover over the data point.

If there are event markers in the chart, you can hover over a marker to see the event count in that time window, grouped by severity.

When you click a data point in a chart, information related to metrics displays on the :strong:`Data Table` tab. When you hover over different areas of the chart, values in the :strong:`Value` column update to reflect the values for the data point your mouse is hovering over. This enables you to compare those values against the pinned values. For more information, see :ref:`data-table`.

You can export the chart contents as a CSV file. To do this, open the :strong:`Options` menu on the :strong:`Data Table` tab and click :strong:`Export as CSV`. The most recent 100 data points are exported, along with the values of the dimensions associated with them.

If you edited a :ref:`plot name <plot-name>` or specified :ref:`display units <plot-display-units>` in the Chart Builder, this information displays when you hover over the chart and on the :strong:`Data Table` tab. For example, instead of seeing ``250`` as a value, you might see ``250 ms`` (where you specified ``ms`` as a suffix) or ``$250/hour`` (where you specified ``$`` as a prefix and ``/hour`` as a suffix).

As you hover over dimensions on the :strong:`Data Table` tab, an :strong:`Actions menu` icon displays. Menu options let you add a filter to the chart's :strong:`Overrides` bar based on the value of the dimension. For more information, see :ref:`filter-from-data-table` and :ref:`navigate-with-data-links`.

Information about nearby events is shown on the :strong:`Events` tab. For more information, see :ref:`event-markers`.
