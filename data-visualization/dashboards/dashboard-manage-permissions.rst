To help you manage read and write permissions, Observability Cloud lets you view
grant and revoke permissions. 

To learn more about permissions, see :ref:`about-permissions`.

If you want to get read or write permission for a dashboard group or dashboard, or if you want to modify permissions,
first determine who already has permissions by displaying the :strong:`Permissions` list.
You can then ask a user who has permission to add you to the permissions list.
