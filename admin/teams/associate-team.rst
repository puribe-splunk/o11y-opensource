When you link Splunk Observability Cloud detectors and dashboard groups to a team, you can create a single status page, called a team landing page, that displays the detectors and dashboard groups.

.. _detectors-link-teams:

Detectors linked to teams
============================================================================

When you link detectors to a team, you get the following features:

* The team landing page displays lists of active alerts.
* On the Alerts page, users can filter the detectors that appear in tabs to
  display only those detectors linked to a specific team.
* You can configure the team so that it's automatically added as a notification recipient
  for the linked detectors. To learn more about specifying teams as notification recipients,
  see :ref:`admin-team-notifications`.


.. note:: You can manually add a team as a notification recipient for any detector; you don't have to link the detector to the team.

.. _create-link-detector-teams:

You can link a detector to a team when you are viewing the :guilabel:`Detectors` tab on the
:guilabel:`Alerts` page or when you are viewing a specific detector. You must have

#. From the drop-down list, select the team you want to link to the detector, then click :guilabel:`Done`.

   asks if you want to send notifications to the team. Click :guilabel:`Yes` to add the team
   as a recipient to each detector rule. Click :guilabel:`No` to leave all recipients as is.

.. note:: Sending alert notifications to a team doesn’t necessarily mean that every team member is
   notified. The team’s notification policy determines which team members receive notifications.

.. _remove-link-detector-team:

Remove the link between a detector and a team
