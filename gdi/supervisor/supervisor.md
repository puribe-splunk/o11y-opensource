## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `supervisor` monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver. This retrieves the state of processes running by the Supervisor.

##  Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.

2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

## Configuration  

This Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Supervisor monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: supervisor
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/supervisor:
    type: supervisor
    ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings 

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | The host/IP address of the Supervisor XML-RPC API. Used to construct the `url` option if not provided. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | The port of the Supervisor XML-RPC API. Used to construct the `url` option if not provided. For example, `localhost`. (**default:** `9001`) |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the monitor connects to the Supervisor via HTTPS instead of HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `path` | no | `string` | The URL path to use for the scrape URL for Supervisor. (**default:** `/RPC2`) |
| `url` | no | `string` | URL on which to scrape Supervisor XML-RPC API. If this is not provided, it is derived from the `host`, `port`, `useHTTPS`, and `path` options. For example, `http://localhost:9001/RPC2`. |
