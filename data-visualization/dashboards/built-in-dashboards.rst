      :description: Built-in dashboards are automatically created in your organization if you deploy any of the integrations.

Dashboards are groupings of visualized metrics, such as charts. Well-designed dashboards can provide useful and actionable insight into your system at a glance.

Splunk Observability Cloud provides built-in dashboards for a wide variety of technologies and services. These dashboards give you immediate visibility into the technologies and services being used in your environment. Built-in dashboards and the charts they contain are read-only. They are automatically created in your organization if you deploy any of the integrations listed on the Integrations page (click :guilabel:`Integrations` on the navigation bar), and they appear in the following locations:

- in the Built-In Dashboard Groups section of the Dashboards page. To learn more, see :ref:`dashboard-basics`.
- in the Dashboard section of the navigators in Infrastructure Monitoring. To learn more, see :ref:`use-navigators`.


In general, built-in dashboards are optimized for monitoring populations as well as individual nodes. For each technology or service, we use aggregations, percentiles, or Top N analytics functions to let you see patterns and identify outliers, and also provide individual metrics for insight into the functioning of single nodes.

In addition, you can use dimension or property to filter built-in dashboards and hone in on a specific slice of your environment. You can also use the Time Range selector to specify the time range for which you want to view the metrics. See :ref:`dashboard-time-range` in :ref:`view-charts-dashboards`.

Because built-in dashboards are read-only, you can't directly save any changes you make to a dashboard or to its charts. For more information, see :ref:`modify-built-in-dashboard`.
