      :description: Learn how you can import and export dashboards to collaborate with other members of your team.

You can import or export dashboards from the UI. You can export the dashboard as a JSON file for other users to import to their dashboard or dashboard group. Exporting a dashboard is also a way to maintain a backup of the dashboard. Splunk does not support editing the exported JSON file, which could negatively impact import.

Failed import
=================================================================

If your import fails, check the following:

- If you tried the :guilabel:`Legacy Import` option, and you exported on or after December 8, 2020, try the :guilabel:`Import` option. The :guilabel:`Legacy Import` option was deprecated as of June 8, 2021.

- If your file name's format is ``dashboard_<dashboard name>.json``, make sure you are using the :guilabel:`Import > Dashboard` option. If your file's name format is ``<group_name>.json``, make sure you are using the :guilabel:`Import > Dashboard Group` option.
