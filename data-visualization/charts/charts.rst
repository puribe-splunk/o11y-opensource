Charts enable you to visualize the metrics you are sending to Splunk Observability Cloud.

A metric is anything that is measurable (you can assign a numerical value to it) and variable (changes over time).

Charts can range from extremely simple (monitor a single metric for a single host in real time) to very sophisticated (apply advanced analytic formulas across several dimensions, compare values for different time periods, configure advanced display settings, and more).

The following sections lead you through developing the expertise you need to build charts that meet your requirements, based on the metrics you want to monitor.
