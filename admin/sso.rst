Configure SSO integrations for Splunk Observability Cloud
*********************************************************************

.. meta::
   :description: Splunk Observability Cloud provides the capability for your users to log in using various SSO providers. Login service integration supports both Identity Provider initiated SSO and Observability Cloud initiated SSO. The latter lets your users log in to Observability Cloud using your organization's custom URL.

Splunk Observability Cloud provides SSO login service integrations that let your users log in using a third-party
identity provider (IdP) that uses SAML SSO. Observability Cloud supports SSO initiated by the IdP. Observability Cloud
also supports SSO initiated by Observability Cloud, and this option lets your users log in to Infrastructure
Monitoring using a :ref:`custom URL<custom-url>` you specify.

Observability Cloud supports the following SSO integrations:

-  :ref:`Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)<sso-adfs>`
-  :ref:`Azure Active Directory<sso-azure>`
-  :ref:`Google<sso-google>`
-  :ref:`Google Cloud Identity (IDP)<sso-google-cloud-identity>`
-  :ref:`Okta<sso-okta>`
-  :ref:`OneLogin<sso-one-login>`
-  :ref:`PingOne<sso-ping-one>`
-  :ref:`Generic SAML SSO<sso-generic>`

.. _custom-url:

Provide a custom URL for accessing Observability Cloud
======================================================================

A custom URL is required to allow users to log in to Observability Cloud from your organization's login page. If no custom URL is provided, users can still log in through the identity provider to access Observability Cloud.

When you configure a login service integration and select :guilabel:`Show on login page`, the login details for the service appear on your organization's login page. You can have multiple SSO logins.

To allow users to log in to Observability Cloud using a custom URL, such as your_org.example.com, send a request to observability-support@splunk.com. Include the URL you want in your request.

.. _naming-note-sso:

Name an SSO integration
=================================

Give your login service integration a name that your users recognize. On your custom login page,
this name appears in the button your users select to sign in. For example, use the name "Log in with Okta"
for an Okta login service integration.

.. _multiple-integrations-sso:

Integrate an identity provider with multiple organizations
============================================================================

When you integrate a login service with Observability Cloud, you need to
provide information about the integration to the login service. Infrastructure
Monitoring gives you an entity identifier (entity ID) that you provide when you
configure the login service itself. The service uses the entity
ID and other information to connect with Observability Cloud.

For multiple organizations, the login service needs an entity ID and other information
for each organization. Observability Cloud can provide you with
an integration-specific entity ID for the integration in each organization.

When you configure the login service, you provide the entity ID along with other information
for each organization you want the login service to connect with. The steps for
integrating with each supported login service include the optional steps for
using integration-specific entity IDs.

The Google SSO integration doesn't support integration-specific entity IDs.

.. note:: You only need an integration-specific entity ID if you want to use the same IdP for multiple organizations.

General integration-specific entity ID steps
-------------------------------------------------

To get an integration-specific entity ID for an integration, do the following
when you create the integration:

#. Access Splunk Observability Cloud.
#. Open the navigation :strong:`Menu`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Data Setup` to open the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` page.
#. In the :guilabel:`Login Services` section, click the tile for the login service integration you want.
#. Click :guilabel:`New Integration`.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Integration-specific Entity ID` option. Next to this option, the
   entity ID displays in the form of a URI. Copy this URI and provide it when you configure the login service to communicate with Observability Cloud.


.. _sso-adfs:

Configure an ADFS SSO integration
================================================================

The Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) SSO integration lets your users
log in to Observability Cloud using your Microsoft ADFS portal.

Before you proceed, review the section :ref:`Name an SSO integration<naming-note-sso>`
to learn about naming your integrations.

This integration is only available for Microsoft Active Directory with
ADFS. In addition, you need to have the following fields in your ADFS configuration:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email

The procedure for configuring ADFS with Observability Cloud has these
sections:

* :ref:`notify-splunk-support`
* :ref:`create-adfs-imm-integration`
* :ref:`add-adfs-relying-party`
* :ref:`obtain-adfs-cert`
* :ref:`obtain-adfs-metadata`
* :ref:`upload-adfs-cert-metadata-im`

.. _notify-splunk-support:

Send your domain information to Splunk Support
--------------------------------------------------------

Your users can't authenticate using an ADFS SSO integration until
Splunk activates it. To request the activation, have an organization
administrator send your login email domain to observability-support@splunk.com. For example, if your users log in to SSO with user IDs like ``kai@example.com``, then ``example.com`` is the login email domain to send to observability-support@splunk.com.

After Splunk Support activates the integration, users can authenticate using
ADFS SSO.


.. _create-adfs-imm-integration:

Create a new ADFS SSO integration in Observability Cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new ADFS integration in Observability Cloud:

#. Access Splunk Observability Cloud.
#. Open the navigation :strong:`Menu`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Data Setup` to open the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` page.
#. In the :guilabel:`Login Services` section, click the :guilabel:`Active Directory FS` tile to display the Active Directory FS page.
#. Click :guilabel:`New Integration`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Name` field, enter a name for your ADFS SSO integration.

The PingOne SSO integration is now available to users in your PingOne application.
When users use the integration for the first time, they receive an email containing a
link that they must open in order to authenticate. This only occurs the first
time the user signs in. Subsequent login attempts don't require validation.

If you want to turn off the email authentication feature, send a request to
observability-support@splunk.com.

PingOne SSO authentication and Observability Cloud username/password authentication are
independent. Existing Observability Cloud users that you created before
enabling the PingOne SSO integration can use their Observability Cloud as well as their
PingOne SSO credentials to log in. Observability Cloud generates a password for users
you create in the PingOne SSO integration. If the PingOne application is unavailable, Observability Cloud
users can use the reset password link on the Observability Cloud login page to get native
Observability Cloud credentials.


.. _sso-generic:

Configure SSO using a generic SAML SSO integration
================================================================

If you use an SSO login service other than the ones listed previously, you
can create a generic SAML SSO integration for your organization.
(If you already have a SAML SSO integration for your organization, follow the steps in
:ref:`saml-install` to install it in Observability Cloud.)

.. _saml-creators:

Generic SAML SSO integrations
-------------------------------------------------------

Observability Cloud provides integrations for specific SAML SSO providers.
If your provider isn't in the list of supported integrations,
your organization administrator can request a generic integration from
Observability Cloud. You can use this integration to test and develop a SAML SSO provider.
Using this integration, administrators can direct Observability Cloud
to use any publicly-available SSO endpoint to authenticate users.

To enable the generic SAML SSO integration, your account administrator needs to
send an email to the Support team (observability-support@splunk.com). The email
must include the domain for the ID/email address that your users provide when
they log in. The domain is the part of the user ID/email address string
that followings the ``@`` sign.

Information required for generic SAML SSO integrations
----------------------------------------------------------------

   * One of:

     * ``User.FirstName`` and ``User.LastName``: User's first and last name
     * ``User.FullName``: User's full name
   * ``User.email``: User's email address
   * ``PersonImmutableID``: A unique identifier for this user

* ACS URL

  Some ACS URLs include realm information. To learn more, see :ref:`Note about realms<about-realms>`.

  The ACS URL includes an integration ID that's unique for each integration.
  The SAML page displays this ID.

  The URL has one of the following formats:

  * If your organization uses the ``us0`` realm:

    ``https://api.signalfx.com/v1/saml/acs/<INTEGRATION_ID>``

  * If your organization uses a realm other than ``us0``:

    ``https://api.<YOUR_REALM>.signalfx.com/v1/saml/acs/<INTEGRATION_ID>``

*  Entity ID

   * If you have a single organization, enter the following entity ID:

      * If your organization uses the ``us0`` realm, enter the following:

        ``https://api.signalfx.com/v1/saml/metadata/<ENTITY-ID>``

      * If your organization uses a realm other than ``us0``, enter the following:

        ``https://api.<YOUR_REALM>.signalfx.com/v1/saml/metadata<ENTITY-ID>``

      ``<ENTITY-ID>`` is the entity ID displayed when you start creating a
      new integration.
   * If you have multiple organizations that you want to integrate with a single IdP,
     do the following:

     #. In the :guilabel:`New Integration` pane, select :guilabel:`Integration-specific Entity ID`.
        Next to the option, the integration-specific entity ID appears in the form of a URI.
     #. Copy the entity ID and provide it when you configure the login service to
        communicate with Observability Cloud.

*  Assertion Signature

   The SSO provider must put the assertion signature in the assertion message,
   not in the request itself.

*  RelayState

   Observability Cloud sends a dynamic RelayState,
   so the SSO provider must accept and pass back the dynamic RelayState.

.. _saml-install:

Install a generic SAML SSO integration
-------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to install a generic SAML SSO integration that your organization
has implemented.

.. _generic-sso-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start an installation, you need the following information:

* :strong:`Name`: Descriptive name that appears in the Generic SAML SSO tile
* :strong:`Public key`: The SAML provider's public key
* :strong:`Issuer URL`: The issuer URL provided by the SSO provider
* One of the following:

  * A publicly-accessible metadata URL provided by the SSO provider
  * Metadata for the SSO provider in XML format. The entity ID that the provider sends
    as part of the metadata must match the issuer URL.

* If you have multiple email domains for users in a single Splunk Observability cloud organization, for example, kai@example.com and deepu@examplehq.com, contact observability-support@splunk.com to whitelist multiple domains.


Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install a generic SAML SSO integration, follow these steps:

#. Access Splunk Observability Cloud.

#. Open the navigation :strong:`Menu`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Data Setup` to open the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` page.

#. In the :guilabel:`Login Services` section, click the :guilabel:`SAML` tile to display the SAML page.

#. Click :guilabel:`New Integration`. A dialog box with fields appears.
#. In the :guilabel:`Name` field, enter the name for this integration. If your organization has a
   :ref:`custom URL<custom-url>`, this name appears as the text for the button users click
   to sign in (see the section :ref:`naming-note-sso`).
#. In the remaining fields, enter the information you gathered in the :ref:`generic-sso-prerequisites` section.
#. Click :guilabel:`Save`. The message :strong:`Validated!` appears.

The generic SSO integration is now available to users of the SSO provider.
When users use the integration for the first time, they receive an email containing a
link that they must open in order to authenticate. This only occurs the first
time the user signs in. Subsequent login attempts don't require validation.

If you want to turn off the email authentication feature, send a request to
observability-support@splunk.com.

Generic SSO authentication and Observability Cloud username/password authentication are
independent. Existing Observability Cloud users that you created before
enabling the generic SSO integration can use their Observability Cloud as well as their
SSO credentials to log in. Observability Cloud generates a password for users
you create in the generic SSO integration. If the SSO application is unavailable, Observability Cloud
users can use the reset password link on the Observability Cloud login page to get native
Observability Cloud credentials.

.. important::  This integration can send credential information to unverified destinations. Although you can
   use generic SAML SSO integrations to authenticate users, Observability Cloud doesn't support these integrations
   as your primary authentication mechanism. The Observability Cloud support team can't help you
   diagnose or repair problems you encounter while trying to authenticate users using generic SSO integrations,
   aside from ensuring that the integration itself is working
