Step 1. Get platform infrastructure data into Splunk Observability Cloud
===========================================================================

This task describes how to install the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector on Windows Server or Linux or in a Kubernetes cluster to start getting platform infrastructure data into Splunk Observability Cloud.

After this data starts flowing into Splunk Observability Cloud, you can:

- :ref:`Monitor your platform infrastructure data using navigators <navigators-imqs>`

- :ref:`Activate an out-of-the-box detector to issue alerts <alerts-imqs>` about specific conditions in your data


Prerequisites
----------------------

- You must be an administrator in Splunk Observability Cloud.

- You must have an access token for the Splunk Observability Cloud organization you want to get data into. If you are using a free trial account, an access token named :strong:`Default` has already been created for you and you can use it to complete this task. For more details about creating organization access tokens, see :new-page-ref:`admin-org-tokens`.

- If you want to monitor Windows Server, you must be an administrator on the host and running one of the following versions:

  - Windows Server 2012 64-bit

  - Windows Server 2016 64-bit

  - Windows Server 2019 64-bit

- If you want to monitor Linux, you must be an administrator on the host and running one of the following versions:

  - Amazon Linux 2

  - CentOS/Red Hat/Oracle 7 or 8

  - Debian 8, 9, or 10

  - Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, or 20.04

  You must also have systemd and cURL installed.

- If you want to monitor Kubernetes, you must be an administrator of the cluster and have the Helm 3.0 client installed and configured.

.. tip:: To help ensure a seamless flow from this task to :ref:`navigators-imqs`, make sure that your infrastructure host or cluster is generating data that can be received by Splunk Observability Cloud. For example, even if a wizard you use in this task provides a confirmation of a valid connection, the navigators won't display unless your infrastructure is actively sending data to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.

          - Kubernetes
          - Enter a name that enables you to uniquely identify your Kubernetes cluster in Splunk Observability Cloud. This name should correspond to the cluster where you are installing the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector.

            For example, in the :ref:`Kubernetes navigator <kubernetes-navigator-imqs>`, you can set the :strong:`Cluster` drop-down value to your cluster name to make the navigator display information about your cluster only.

        * - :strong:`Provider`
          - Kubernetes
          - Select the location of the Kubernetes cluster where you are installing the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector:

            * :strong:`Amazon Web Services`

            * :strong:`Microsoft Azure`

            * :strong:`Google Cloud Platform`

            * :strong:`Google GKE` (Google Kubernetes Engine)

            * :strong:`Other`

        * - :strong:`Add Gateway`
          - Kubernetes
          - When you install Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes, it will automatically and always run in agent mode.

            * Select :strong:`Yes` to deploy a gateway service, in addition to running the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector in agent mode. With this configuration, collectors running in agent mode can send data to the gateway and the gateway sends data to Splunk Observability Cloud. Splunk recommends using this configuration if your Kubernetes cluster has more than 25 hosts. Agents installed with this gateway (using the same Helm chart) are automatically configured to send data to this gateway.

              If you have other Splunk OpenTelemetry Collectors running in agent mode in other clusters, you can manually configure them to point to this gateway.

            * Select :strong:`No` if you don’t want to deploy a gateway service. For example, if you have an existing gateway running in your Kubernetes implementation, you don't need to deploy another. This option installs the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector running in agent mode. If you have an existing gateway running, you can manually configure the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector installed by this task to point to that gateway.

            For more installation details, see :new-page-ref:`otel-install-k8s`.

#. Click :strong:`Next`. The Install Integration screen displays.

.. _navigators-imqs:

Step 3: Monitor your platform and cloud infrastructure
================================================================================

Now that you have data about your infrastructure, such as platform hosts, Kubernetes clusters, and cloud provider services, flowing into Splunk Observability Cloud, you can use out-of-the-box navigators to explore your data.


Prerequisites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigators display only if Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring is receiving data from your source.

For example, even if a wizard you used in :ref:`gdi-infrastructure-imqs` or :ref:`gdi-cloud-imqs` provided confirmation of a valid connection, the navigators don't display unless your host, Kubernetes cluster, or cloud provider service is actively sending data to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.

If you don't see a navigator after 15 minutes of making a valid connection, check your source to ensure that it is generating data. For example, ensure that your host, cluster, or service is actually being used in a way that generates data that it can send to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.


Tips for working with navigators
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigators are primarily composed of charts.

- Hover over a chart to see details about specific metric time series.

- Click within a chart to see the data table for a given time period.

- Click a chart title in the top left of a chart to display the full chart along with more chart options, such as a plot editor and the ability to change the chart's visualization type to area, column, or histogram, for example.

  .. image:: /_images/infrastructure/elb-navigator-chart.gif
    :width: 100%
    :alt: This animated GIF shows hover and click actions on a chart to display metric time series, a data table, and full chart data.

  |

- Every chart has a :strong:`Chart Actions` menu. Click the more (|more|) icon in the upper right of a chart to open the menu and view available actions. For example, you can share the chart, download it as an image, or export it as a CSV (comma-separated values) file.

  .. image:: /_images/infrastructure/chart-actions.png
    :width: 70%
    :alt: This screenshot shows the Chart actions menu displaying available options such as Share, Download Chart as Image, and Export Chart as CSV.

For more details about Microsoft Azure service navigators, see :new-page-ref:`monitor-azure-services`.

To narrow the scope of the data shown in the navigator, such as to only the data received from the connection you just made, click :strong:`Add Filter` and select a key and value that uniquely identify your connection. For example, you can select :strong:`subscription_id` = :strong:`<your subscription ID>`, where the subscription ID value is the one associated with a subscription you provided in :ref:`gdi-cloud-imqs`. Click :strong:`Apply Filter`.

Splunk Observability Cloud also provides :new-page-ref:`built-in (out of the box) dashboards <dashboards>` that you can use to explore your Microsoft Azure data. To access these dashboards, open the navigation :strong:`Menu` and select :strong:`Dashboards`. The Dashboards page displays. Search for :strong:`Azure`. Several Microsoft Azure dashboard groups display. Click a link to access a relevant dashboard.

Step 4. Activate an out-of-the-box detector to issue alerts
========================================================================

Now that you have data flowing into Splunk Observability Cloud and you can explore that data using navigators and dashboards, let’s set up an alert that can help keep you informed about certain conditions in your data.

To create an alert, you first create a detector that monitors data for conditions you want to be alerted about. When a condition you want to be alerted about is met, the detector issues an alert.

This task describes how to create a detector directly from a chart in a navigator or dashboard covered in :ref:`navigators-imqs`.

#. Access the chart you want to create a detector from. This example creates a detector based on the :strong:`Memory Used %` chart in the :ref:`host-navigator-imqs`.

#. Click the :strong:`Get Alerts` icon in the upper right of a chart. For some chart data, we provide built-in templates to enable you to easily create detectors for useful alert conditions. For example, for the :strong:`Memory Used %` chart, we provide a :strong:`Memory utilization % greater than historical norm` detector template.

      :alt: This screenshot shows the New Detector from Chart menu displaying available built-in detctor templates, such as the Memory utilization % greater than historical norm template.

    This detector sends an alert when memory usage for the last 10 minutes was significantly higher than normal, as compared to the last 24 hours.

#. The :strong:`New Detector` panel displays. Click :strong:`Add Recipients` to add an email, :new-page-ref:`Splunk Observability Cloud team <admin-manage-teams>`, or :new-page-ref:`webhook <webhook>` that you want to receive the alert.

      :alt: This screenshot shows the New Detector: Memory utilization % greater than historical norm detector template.

#. Click :strong:`Activate`. When the data condition is met, Splunk Observability Cloud sends a notification to designated recipients and displays alerts on the Alerts page.
