Send alert notifications to Slack using Splunk Observability Cloud
*********************************************************************

You can configure Splunk Observability Cloud to automatically send alert notifications to Slack when a detector alert condition is met and when the alert clears.

To send Observability Cloud alert notifications to Slack, complete the following configuration tasks:

* :ref:`slack1`

   You must be an Observability Cloud administrator, Slack administrator, and be authorized to add apps to Slack to perform this task.

* :ref:`slack2`


.. _slack1:

Step 1: Create a Slack integration in Observability Cloud
=================================================================================

You must be an Observability Cloud administrator, Slack administrator, and be authorized to add apps to Slack to perform this task.

This method of integrating with Slack replaces a prior design. Slack integrations created using the prior design display an option to upgrade in the Observability Cloud UI. While the prior design continues to work, upgrade your integrations to use the newer integration design. You must upgrade your integration if you want image previews to display when pasting a chart URL into Slack. To learn more, see :ref:`pasting-chart-url-into-slack`.

To create a Slack integration in Observability Cloud:

#. In the Observability Cloud navigation menu, select :strong:`Data Setup`.

#. In the :strong:`CATEGORIES` menu, select :strong:`Notification Services`.

#. Click the :strong:`Slack` tile.

#. Click :strong:`New Integration` to display the configuration options.

   If you get an error, you aren't authorized to add apps to Slack and won't be able to create this integration. Contact your Slack administrator for help.

#. Review the permissions required by Slack and click :strong:`Authorize`.

#. By default, the name of the integration is :strong:`Slack`. Give your integration a unique and descriptive name. For information about the downstream use of this name, see :new-page-ref:`About naming your integrations <naming-note>`.

#. Click :strong:`Save`.

Step 2: Add a Slack integration as a detector alert recipient in Observability Cloud
=================================================================================================

..
  once the detector docs are migrated - this step may be covered in those docs and can be removed from these docs. below link to :ref:`detectors` and :ref:`receiving-notifications` instead once docs are migrated

To add a Slack integration as a detector alert recipient in Observability Cloud:

#. Create or edit a detector that you want to configure to send alert notifications using your Slack integration.

    For more information about working with detectors, see :ref:`create-detectors` and :ref:`subscribe`.

#. In the :strong:`Alert recipients` step, click :strong:`Add Recipient`.

#. Select :strong:`Slack` and then select the name of the Slack integration you want to use to send alert notifications. This is the integration name you created in :ref:`slack1`.

#. Enter the name of the Slack channel you want to send the notifications to.

#. Activate and save the detector.

Observability Cloud will send an alert notification to the Slack channel when an alert is triggered by the detector and when the alert clears.
