You can configure an application receiver to gather metrics from its associated application and the host the application is running on.

To find a receiver for your application, see the alphabetical listing of receivers on this page, or use the left navigation menu for this section to browse for receivers by application category.

Receiver functionality is also provided in the form of SignalFx Smart Agent monitors. Documentation in this section describes configuration options for both Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector receivers and Smart Agent monitors.

The SignalFx Smart Agent is deprecated. For details, see the :new-page:`Deprecation Notice <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/smartagent-deprecation-notice.md>`.
