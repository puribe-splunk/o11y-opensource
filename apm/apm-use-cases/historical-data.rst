    :description: A Splunk APM use cases describes how to configure APM Business Workflows

Skyler, a performance engineer at Buttercup Games, wants to understand and analyze the end-to-end behavior of microservices to optimize the system. Skyler opens the service-level Splunk APM services dashboard among the :strong:`Built-in Dashboard Groups` in Splunk Observability Cloud:

Skyler selects the :strong:`checkoutservice` because the service triggered the APM detector for abnormal latency multiple times during the past six months. Skyler sets the dashboard time range to the past six months to analyze its long-term latency distribution.

From the latency chart, Skyler notices that the time when the :strong:`checkoutservice` had high latency are the days that Buttercup Games was having special sales or deploying major code changes to the system. Skyler identifies them as possible causes of the high latency and uses this information to improve system performance.
