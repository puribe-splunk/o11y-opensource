# Health Checker

<meta name="description" content="Documentation for the health-checker monitor">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the Health Checker monitor with the SignalFx Smart Agent receiver. The integration checks whether the configured JSON value is returned in the response body.

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

Follow these steps to deploy the integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Health Checker monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/health-checker
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/health-checker:
    type: collectd/health-checker
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/health-checker` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the Health Checker monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `path` | no | `string` | The HTTP path that contains a JSON document to verify (**default:** `/`) |
| `jsonKey` | no | `string` | If `jsonKey` and `jsonVal` are given, the given endpoint will be interpreted as a JSON document and will be expected to contain the given key and value for the service to be considered healthy. |
| `jsonVal` | no | `any` | This can be either a string or numeric type |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If `true`, the endpoint will be connected to on HTTPS instead of plain HTTP.  It is invalid to specify this if `tcpCheck` is `true`. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipSecurity` | no | `bool` | If `true`, and `useHTTPS` is `true`, the server's SSL/TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `tcpCheck` | no | `bool` | If `true`, the plugin will verify that it can connect to the given host/port value. JSON checking is not supported. (**default:** `false`) |
