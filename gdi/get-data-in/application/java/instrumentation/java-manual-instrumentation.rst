   :description: Manually instrument your Java application when you need to add custom attributes to spans or want to manually generate spans. Keep reading to learn how to manually instrument your Java application for Observability Cloud. 

Instrumenting applications automatically using the agent of the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java covers most needs. Manually instrumenting your application is only necessary when, for example, you need to add custom attributes to spans or need to manually generate spans.

For instructions on how to send custom JVM application metrics, see :ref:`java-otel-custom-metrics`.

For instructions on how to manually instrument Java applications, see the Manual instrumentation docs in the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation repository at https://opentelemetry.io/docs/java/manual_instrumentation.

.. note:: Manual OTel instrumentation is fully compatible with Splunk automatic JVM instrumentation and is fully supported by Splunk.
