  :description: Link detectors to charts in Splunk Observability Cloud so that you can discover and diagnose issues more quickly.

Detectors constantly monitor signals for conditions or issues, triggering alerts when needed. When you link detectors to charts, you can discover and diagnose issues at a glance from your dashboards. If you :ref:`create a new detector from a chart <create-detector-from-chart>`, a link to the new detector is automatically added to the chart.

.. _display-detector-state:

Linked detectors color the border of the charts, tables, and icons with the color of the highest alert severity for all detectors linked to that chart. In the following example, the green border means there are no active alerts. If there is no border, then the chart has no linked detectors.
