Create a dashboard group
=============================================================================

You can create a custom dashboard group for other people in your organization to have easy access to the dashboards in the group. You can create a dashboard group when you are saving a dashboard, or you can create a group from scratch.

To create a dashboard group from scratch, take the following steps:

#. Select :guilabel:`Dashboard Group` from the :strong:`Create` menu on the navigation bar.
#. Enter a name and (optionally) a description of the group.
#. Set write permissions if needed, then click :guilabel:`Create`. To learn more, see :ref:`about-permissions`.
#. After that, you land on a dashboard with the same name as the group. You can rename the dashboard from the dashboard's Actions menu, or just begin adding charts to the group.

For more information on creating charts, see :ref:`simple-charts-dashboards` and :ref:`create-charts`.
