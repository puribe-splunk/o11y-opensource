    :description: A Splunk APM use cases describes how to use APM Tag Spotlight of Business Workflows to accelerate troubleshooting

Deepu, the payment service owner at Buttercup Games, wants to understand how errors in the payment service impact business KPIs. Deepu clicks the :strong:`paymentservice` node on the service map, and then selects :strong:`Tag Spotlight` to look at errors and latency for the :strong:`Workflow` tag.

Deepu notices that the requests of the :strong:`frontend:/cart/checkout` workflow return a majority of root cause errors. Because APM supports infinite cardinality, Deepu selects the :strong:`frontend:/cart/checkout`  workflow and applies filters to show only data from traces. Deepu filters :strong:`version` to ``v350.10`` and :strong:`Kind` to ``SERVER`` to view the tags to examine the subset of traces where the most errors occur:

Because Splunk APM stores all traces without sampling, Deepu clicks the peak of errors on the chart to see example traces of those tag combinations at that timestamp. Deepu finds that the requests from :strong:`checkoutservice` to :strong:`paymentservice` are failing. 

Deepu remembers that version 350.10 of the payment service recently deployed a backwards incompatible change to its API. Because Deepu enabled Related Content  in Splunk APM, Deepu can click :strong:`Logs for payment service` to switch to Splunk Log Observer to investigate whether the deployment causes the error.
