   :description: Get started monitoring applications with Splunk Observability Cloud.


=========================================
What is Splunk APM?
=========================================
Collect :ref:`traces and spans<apm-traces-spans>` to monitor your distributed applications with Splunk APM. A trace is a collection of actions, or spans, that occur to complete a transaction. Splunk APM collects and analyzes every span and trace from each of the services that you have connected to Splunk Observability Cloud to give you full-fidelity access to all of your application data.

| For an interactive walkthrough of Splunk APM, see :new-page:`APM Scenarios <https://quickdraw.splunk.com/redirect/?product=Observability&location=apm-walkthrough&version=current>`.

   * - :strong:`Do this`
     - :strong:`With this tool`
     - :strong:`Link to documentation`

   * -  Start to gain insights from your data in minutes using default landing page and service dashboards.
     - Landing page
     - :ref:`Understand the landing page<apm-landing-page>`

   * - View all of your services and their dependency relationships in the service map.
     - Service map
     - :ref:`Explore the service map<apm-service-map>`

   * - Get a top-down view of your services that provides the request and error rate or latency by each of your indexed span tags in Tag Spotlight. For instance, you can see at a glance how your services are performing by ``endpoint``, ``environment``, or ``span.kind``. You can filter this view by environments, services, Business Workflows, or span tags for a finer-grained look.
     - Tag Spotlight
     - :ref:`apm-tag-spotlight`

   * - Index additional span tags to break down and analyze application performance along any dimension, so that you can customize views like Tag Spotlight to your particular needs.
     - Span tags
     - :ref:`apm-add-context-trace-span`

   * - Use built-in dashboards to assess service, endpoint, and Business Workflow system health at a glance.
     - Built-in dashboards
     - :ref:`built-in-dashboards`

   * - Search all traces from all of your systems, with no sampling, so you can be confident the specific trace you need to resolve an edge cases is retained.
     - Full fidelity tracing
     - :ref:`apm-traces-spans`

   * - Use detectors to alert with custom alert, request, and duration (RED) metrics to monitor error rate and latency across all of your services.
     - Detectors and alerts
     - :ref:`Detectors and alerts<apm-alerts>`

   * - Correlate traces that make up end-to-end transactions in your system to monitor the workflows you care about most
     - Business Workflows
     - :ref:`apm-workflows`

   * - Jump between components of Splunk Observability Cloud by clicking related data

Get your data into Splunk APM
=============================
To start using APM, see :ref:`Set up Splunk APM <apm>`.

If you have already instrumented your applications but are not seeing your data coming into APM as you expect, see :ref:`Troubleshoot your instrumentation <instr-troubleshooting>`.
