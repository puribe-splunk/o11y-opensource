## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the SNMP agent monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver.

This monitor reports metrics from SNMP agents.

**Note:** This SNMP agent monitor does not currently support MIB look ups because of a dependency on `net-snmp` and specifically the commands `snmptranslate` and `snmptable`.

## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.

2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.


## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing an SNMP agent monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
  - type: telegraf/snmp
    ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/snmp:
    type: telegraf/snmp
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/snmp` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

The following is an example SNMP agent Smart Agent monitor configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: telegraf/snmp
   agents:
     - "127.0.0.1:161"
   version: 2
   community: "public"
   fields:
     - name: "uptime"
       oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
```

The following is an example SNMP agent Smart Agent monitor configuration using a discovery rule to discover and configure for a specific SNMP agent:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: telegraf/snmp
   discoveryRule: container_name =~ "snmp" && port == 161
   version: 2
   community: "public"
   fields:
     - name: "uptime"
       oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
```

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the SNMP agent monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | Host and port will be concatenated and appended to the list of SNMP agents to connect to. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | Port and Host will be concatenated and appended to the list of SNMP agents to connect to. (**default:** `0`) |
| `agents` | no | `list of strings` | SNMP agent address and ports to query for information. An example address is `0.0.0.0:5555`. If an address is supplied without a port, the default port `161` will be used. |
| `retries` | no | `integer` | The number of times to retry. (**default:** `0`) |

| `secName` | no | `string` | Name to used to authenticate with SNMP v3 requests. |
| `authProtocol` | no | `string` | Protocol to used to authenticate SNMP v3 requests: `"MD5"`, `"SHA"`, or `""` (default). |
| `authPassword` | no | `string` | Password used to authenticate SNMP v3 requests. |
| `privProtocol` | no | `string` | Protocol used for encrypted SNMP v3 messages: `DES`, `AES`, or `""` (default). |
| `privPassword` | no | `string` | Password used to encrypt SNMP v3 messages. |
| `engineID` | no | `string` | The SNMP v3 engine ID. |
| `engineBoots` | no | `uint32` | The SNMP v3 engine boots. (**default:** `0`) |
| `engineTime` | no | `uint32` | The SNMP v3 engine time. (**default:** `0`) |
| `name` | no | `string` | The top-level measurement name |
| `fields` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | The top-level SNMP fields |
| `tables` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | SNMP Tables |

The **nested** `fields` configuration object has the following fields:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | no | `string` | Name of the field. The OID will be used if no value is supplied. |
| `oid` | no | `string` | The OID to fetch. |
| `oidIndexSuffix` | no | `string` | The sub-identifier to strip off when matching indexes to other fields. |
| `oidIndexLength` | no | `integer` | The index length after the table OID. The index will be truncated after this length to remove length index suffixes or non-fixed values. (**default:** `0`) |
| `isTag` | no | `bool` | Whether to output the field as a tag. (**default:** `false`) |
| `conversion` | no | `string` | Controls the type conversion applied to the value: `"float(X)"`, `"float"`, `"int"`, `"hwaddr"`, `"ipaddr"`, or `""` (default). |
