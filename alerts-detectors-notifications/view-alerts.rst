   :description: You can view currently active alerts on the Alerts page or in the Infrastructure Navigator

Alerts are highly relevant to the health of your services and applications. Observability Cloud shows alerts in all places where they matter, so that you don't miss on important information.

You can view active alerts on the :ref:`Alerts page <alerts-page>`, from :ref:`charts <view-alerts-for-related>` and :ref:`detectors <view-alerts-within-detector>`, or access them :ref:`from APM <view-apm-alerts>`.


.. _alerts-page:

Review all active alerts in your organization
=============================================================

To review all the active alerts in your organization, go to :guilabel:`Alerts`. The :guilabel:`Active Alerts` tab shows the number of active alerts at each severity level, from critical to informative.

      :alt: Alert counters in the Active Alerts tab

The table lists all active alerts matching the conditions you've entered. If a notification for an alert is :ref:`muted <mute-notifications>`, a :guilabel:`notifications muted` label is shown next to the alert.

To see more details about the alert, click its rule name and source in the table. In the details dialog box, you can click :guilabel:`Resolve` the alert, open the detector that triggered the alert, and explore related items.

.. tip:: If you can't find an alert, :ref:`apply a filter <alerts-filter>` to reduce the number of matching alerts.

.. _alerts-filter:

Filter alerts to reduce noise
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You can click on any of the alert counters to filter alerts by the corresponding severity level. You can also use :guilabel:`Filter` to show only alerts that are relevant to specific tags or dimensions.

To filter by service, endpoint, environment, or business workflow, set the :guilabel:`APM Filters`.

.. _alerts-group:

Group alerts by properties or dimensions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use :guilabel:`Group by` to group active alerts by one or more properties. For example, you can group alerts by host first, followed by the AWS region. When you select two levels, hierarchical grouping is also applied to the list.
