    :description: A Splunk APM use cases describes how to use APM Tag Spotlight to find root cause errors

Deepu, the payment service owner at Buttercup Games, receives an alert that the service error rate of payment service goes above the threshold set for a Splunk APM detector. After checking the infrastructure and finding no problem, Deepu reviews the serviceâ€™s Request/Errors rate and Latency generated by Splunk APM on the alert. 

In the meantime, Deepu receives a notification from Kai, the site reliability engineer. The notification says that the high root cause error rate with the ``/PaymentService/Charge endpoint`` is preventing customers from shopping on the Buttercup Games website. The notification also includes a link to the endpoint on the Splunk APM service map. Deepu clicks the :strong:`paymentservice` node on the service map and selects the :strong:`Tag Spotlight` view on the sidebar:

Scanning through requests and errors correlated with each indexed tag, Deepu sees that the errors are evenly distributed for all tag values except the :strong:`version` tag. All errors occur in version 350.10, a recent code release to the service. Deepu rolls back to the previous release, version 350.9, to keep the site running while notifying and waiting for the engineers to solve the issue.

Deepu narrows the investigation to the code in version 350.10 of the ``/PaymentService/Charge`` endpoint and clicks the :strong:`Request/Errors` chart to get an example trace to see what the error is. Because Deepu enabled Related Content in Splunk APM, Deepu can click :strong:`Logs for trace` to switch to Splunk Log Observer for further troubleshooting.
