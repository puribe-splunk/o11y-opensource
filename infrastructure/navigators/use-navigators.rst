    :description: Use a navigator in Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

A navigator gives you two options to monitor your instances, heat map view and table view:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40, 60

   * - :strong:`Instance monitoring option`
     - :strong:`Description`

   * - Heat map view
     - In heat map view, which is the default view for a navigator, each square has a color that represents the relative value of the metric you select from the :guilabel:`Color by` drop-down menu.

       * The colors range from low values (lighter colors) to high values (darker colors).

       * You canâ€™t change the default colors for each Color |hyph| by option.

       * The navigator automatically sets the value range for each color.

   * - Table view
     - In table view, instances are sorted in descending order based on the relative value of the metric you select from the :guilabel:`Color by` drop-down menu.

       * You can reverse the sorting order or select different sorting criteria by clicking available column headers.

       * You can't add or remove columns from table view.


.. note::
    In table view, some columns might be missing data for instances reporting through the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector in the Amazon EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and Azure Virtual Machines navigators. This is due to differences in property names between the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector and native agents such as CloudWatch.

For information on customizing the content and format of the navigator, including filtering, grouping, and more, see :ref:`customize-navigator`.

For interactive walkthroughs of how to use navigators in Infrastructure Monitoring to troubleshoot your web server or observe your application and the underlying infrastructure, see :new-page:`Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring web server troubleshooting scenario <https://bossofopsando11y.com/imt/webserver-troubleshooting.html>` and :new-page:`Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring application monitoring scenario <https://bossofopsando11y.com/imt/application-monitoring.html>`.

.. note::

   The format and content displayed in the navigator for AWS Lambda is different from what is discussed below.

.. _drill-down:

Drill down
----------

In heat map view, when you hover over a square in a navigator, you can see the information about the instance represented by the square. Click a square to drill down into that instance.

Alternatively, while in table view, you can click the instance ID of an instance to drill down into that instance.

For example, if you click a square representing a host instance, you can see system metrics information in the built-in dashboard with charts. You can also find various properties of the host, processes running on the host, and so on on the Properties sidebar.

.. note::

   The color or statistics for an element might change as you drill down or click through your system. This is because the information might be refreshed between the time you begin navigating and the time a target element is displayed.

As you drill down into a single instance, you can use the breadcrumb trail to switch to the drill-down view of another instance or to return to the navigator view.


.. _related-instances:

Display related resources or views
----------------------------------

In the drill-down view of a host instance, available related resources show up in a navigation menu at the bottom.

.. note::
    Related resources and views are currently only available for host instances.

You can click available related resources that navigate to other Splunk Observability Cloud components, or other views of the same host in a different context.

The following example shows you how to navigate from the drill-down view of a single host to Splunk Log Observer view and back:

#. Select :guilabel:`Navigation menu > Infrastructure`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Hosts` under :guilabel:`My Data Center`.
#. Click a square to select a host instance you want to drill down into. For instance, you want to look into the details of a host named ``ip-10-0-3-92.us-west-2.compute.internal``.
#. Once you are in the drill-down view for ``ip-10-0-3-92.us-west-2.compute.internal``, you can navigate to Splunk Log Observer to see all logs for the same host by clicking :guilabel:`Logs for host ip-10-0-3-92.us-west-2.compute.internal` on the related resources navigation menu.
#. If you click any log on the list, the related resources navigation menu shows up. To navigate back to the drill-down view for the same host instance, click :guilabel:`Host called ip-10-0-3-92.us-west-2.compute.internal` on the related resources navigation menu.

.. _dashboard-section:

Use the Dashboard section
-------------------------

The Dashboard section in each navigator provides access to detailed information about the instances displayed.

For more detail on the Dashboard section, see :ref:`built-in-dashboards`.

.. note::

    Amazon EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and Azure Virtual Machines instances are powered by their respective public cloud services as well as Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector. You need both for all the charts to display data in the built-in dashboards.

    - If you have only the public cloud service and the Smart Agent configured, some charts in the built-in dashboards for Amazon EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and Azure Virtual Machines instances display no data.
    - If you have only the public cloud service configured, you can see all the cards representing the services where data come from, but some charts in the built-in dashboards for Amazon EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and Azure Virtual Machines instances display no data.
    - If you have only Smart Agent configured, Amazon EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and Azure Virtual Machines instance navigators aren't available.

.. _customize-navigator:

Customize navigator display
-----------------------------

The control bar within each navigator lets you modify which instances are shown, how they are grouped, which metric you are focusing on, and so on.

.. _add-filter:

Add filter
==========

Click :guilabel:`Add Filter` to create a filter and view a specific slice of your environment based on dimensions or properties you specify. Filtering is particularly useful for viewing just the instances running a specific service, or in a particular availability zone.

Filters that you apply to your host instances also filter dependencies in the navigator sidebar. To learn more about the navigator sidebar, see  :ref:`navigator-sidebar` in the same topic.

.. _customize-time-range:

Customize time range
====================

By default, you see data from the last 3 hours. You can use the time picker to choose a new time range. When you select a new time range, the navigator updates to show the status of instances during that time.

If the time between the end and start dates of your selected time range is more than 7 days, the navigator might take longer to respond.

.. _color-by:

Color by
========

Use the :guilabel:`Color by` drop-down menu in the control bar to specify the metric you want to use to color the squares. Square color values vary depending on which Color |hyph| by criteria you choose.

For example, if you select :guilabel:`CPU Utilization`, colors range from green (lowest 20% of values among all instances) to red (highest 20% of values among all instances). For many metrics, red indicates intensity of performance rather than a problem situation.

.. commenting this out because there is currently no Alerts tab in the UI -trangl (06/15/2021)
  You can also color by the "Most severe alert." The highest severity currently active alert in each instance is determined, and the squares are colored from green (no alerts) to red (one or more critical alerts). In this view, red does in fact indicate a problem situation that you will probably want to address. You can start by looking at the Alerts tab below the visualization. For information on working with a list of alerts, see :ref:`view-alerts`.

- White squares indicate instances that do not emit values for the specified metric.

- Black squares indicate instances considered "dead" by Infrastructure Monitoring because they do not emit values for a specified period of time.

  You can specify settings related to these non-emitting instances by selecting :guilabel:`Navigator Settings` from the Actions menu. When the instances begin emitting values again, the squares are recolored accordingly.


.. _group-by:

Group by
========

Use the :guilabel:`Group by` drop-down menu in the control bar to partition instances by the selected dimension or property. As you hover over or select the different options in the list, the instances immediately rearrange themselves in the navigator. This feature allows you to do a hierarchical grouping of up to two levels.

In some cases, you may see an option titled "n/a" in the drop-down menu. This group contains instances that don't have a value for the Group |hyph| by dimension or property you specify.

When you specify a Group |hyph| by field, you can click a group name to filter the navigator to only show the instances in that group. The breadcrumb trail updates to indicate your selected group.

.. _outliers:

Find outliers
=============

Apply outlier detection to identify instance outliers in your data. Outliers are denoted by the color red based on values of the :ref:`color-by` metric.

Outlier detection can be determined by one of two strategies that are common in data analysis:

-  Deviation from population mean

    Highlight instances with values significantly above the average value of other instances. This strategy tends to highlight only those instances with the most extreme values, and generally provides meaningful results only when you have a large number of instances (15 or more).

-  Deviation from the population median

    Highlight instances with values significantly above the median value of other instances. If there are relatively small differences in value among the majority of instances, this strategy tends to highlight any instance which is not part of this majority.

For example, if instances are grouped by the service that they are running, colored by ``cpu.utilization``, and outlier detection is enabled, then instances that use significantly more CPU than their others are highlighted in red. You can then investigate those specific instances to determine why they are behaving differently.

While both outlier strategies highlight instances that are behaving differently from others, if the population has two groups of outliers (e.g. most instances are running at 20% CPU utilization but there are 3 running at 60% and 1 more running at 80%), deviation from mean finds the greater outlier (instances running at 80%), while the deviation from median can typically identify both groups. You can always switch from one strategy to another to choose the one that works best for your specific environment.

The Find Outliers feature also provides a population selector that allows you to restrict the comparison population to only those instances that have similar characteristics (as defined by the Group By dimension). For example, you might not want to compare a server against others that are running different software. It is more relevant to determine outliers among servers providing the same service. Grouping instances by the service that they run and using that as your population basis ensures that instances are compared only with their peers to determine if they behave abnormally.

.. _navigator-sidebar:

View dependencies in the navigator sidebar
----------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Available only for hosts and virtual hosts.

In navigators for hosts in :strong:`My Data Center` and virtual hosts, Amazon EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Cloud Platform, you can track dependent services in the navigator sidebar.

Prerequisites
==============

To see the services you want to track in the navigator sidebar, you have to configure them in the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file as a ``service.name`` value under ``extraDimensions``.

For example, the ``redis-cart`` service is included in this Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    receiver_creator:
      receivers:
        smartagent/redis:
         rule: type == "pod" && name contains "redis"
         config:
           type: collectd/redis
           host: redis-cart
           port: 6379
           extraDimensions:
             service.name: redis-cart

For more information on Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, see :ref:`otel-components`.

Navigate to services using the navigator sidebar
===================================================

The following example shows you how to navigate to a Cassandra service from the Amazon EC2 navigator.

In this Amazon EC2 navigator, Cassandra and Kafka services are running on the Amazon EC2 instances. Each tile in the navigator sidebar represents a service type.

.. image:: /_images/infrastructure/navigator-sidebar.png
    :width: 99%
    :alt: This image shows what the navigator sidebar looks like in a navigator.

#. To see the full list of Cassandra services, hover over or click the Cassandra tile.

    .. image:: /_images/infrastructure/cassandra-services.png
        :width: 99%
        :alt: This image shows the list of Cassandra services.

#. To search for a specific service, type the name of the service in the search field.

   When you have a large number of running service types or services, the navigator sidebar might hide some of them and instead display the text :strong:`Show all services`. Use search to find a specific service without having to expand the entire list.

   For example, type ``metadata`` to look for service names containing the keyword.

    .. image:: /_images/infrastructure/service-search.png
        :width: 99%
        :alt: This image shows the search result for ``metadata`` services.

#. Click a Cassandra service to navigate to the navigator or dashboard for that service. When both navigator and dashboard are available for a service, clicking that service takes you to the navigator.
