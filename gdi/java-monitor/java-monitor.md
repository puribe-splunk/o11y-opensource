<meta name="Description" content="Documentation on the java-monitor integration for Splunk Observability Cloud">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `java-monitor` receiver by using the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver.

Use the Java receiver to retrieve metrics from a Java application.

This receiver is available on Linux and Windows.

### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```
receivers:
  smartagent/java-monitor:
    type: java-monitor
    ... # Additional config
```

To complete the receiver activation, you must also include the receiver in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [java-server]
```

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the java-monitor receiver:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | Host is filled in by auto-discovery if the receiver has a discovery rule. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | Port is filled in by auto-discovery if the receiver has a discovery rule. Default value is `0`. |
| `jarFilePath` | no | `string` | Path to the jar file that implements the monitoring logic. |
| `javaBinary` | no | `string` | By default, the agent use its bundled Java runtime (Java 8). If you wish to use a Java runtime that already exists on the system, specify the full path to the `java` binary here in `/usr/bin/java`. |
| `mainClass` | no | `string` | The class within the specified `jarFilePath` that contains a main method to execute. |
| `classPath` | no | `list of strings` | Additional class paths to set on the invoked Java subprocess. |
| `extraJavaArgs` | no | `list of strings` | Additional flags to the Java subprocess |
