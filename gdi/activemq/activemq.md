<meta name="description" content="Documentation on the activemq monitor">


## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the Apache ActiveMQ monitor via the Smart Agent Receiver.

This integration with ActiveMQ wraps the GenericJMX monitor to monitor ActiveMQ. This integration works with ActiveMQ 5.8.0 and higher.

Use this monitor to gather the following types of information from ActiveMQ:

* Broker (Totals per broker)

* Queue (Queue status)

* Topic (Topic status)


## Installation

This monitor is available in the SignalFx Smart Agent Receiver, which is part of the {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

To install this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.

2. Configure the monitor, as described in the next section.


## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing an Apache ActiveMQ monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
  - type: collectd/activemq
    ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/activemq:
    type: collectd/activemq
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/activemq` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the Apache ActiveMQ monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host to connect to. JMX must be configured for remote access and accessible from the agent. |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | JMX connection port (NOT the RMI port) on the application. This corresponds to the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` Java property that should be set on the JVM when running the application. |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the Splunk Observability Cloud UI so that you can get built-in content for it. For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string. This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this configuration. **Note**: Under normal circumstances, it is not advised to set this string directly. Setting the host and port as specified above is preferred. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix. If a second `instancePrefix` is specified in a referenced MBean block, the prefix specified in the Connection block will appear at the beginning of the plugin instance and the prefix specified in the MBean block will be appended to it. |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username to authenticate to the server |
| `password` | no | `string` | User password to authenticate to the server |
| `customDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | Takes in key-value pairs of custom dimensions at the connection level. |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of strings` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeansToOmit` | no | `list of strings` | A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come in handy in cases where only a few MBeans need to be omitted from the default list. |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of objects (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics. If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those. |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` configuration object has the following fields:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` | Sets the pattern that is used to retrieve MBeans from the MBeanServer. If more than one MBean is returned, you should use the `instanceFrom` option to make the identifiers unique. |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix. |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of strings` | The object names used by JMX to identify MBeans include so-called "properties" that are basically key-value pairs. If the given object name is not unique and multiple MBeans are returned, the values of those properties usually differ. You can use this option to build the plugin instance from the appropriate property values. This option is optional and may be repeated to generate the plugin instance from multiple property values. |
| `values` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | The `value` blocks map one or more attributes of an MBean to a value list in the agent. There must be at least one `value` block within each MBean block |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of strings` |  |


The **nested** `values` configuration object has the following fields:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` | Sets the data set used within the agent to handle the values of the MBean attribute. |
| `table` | no | `bool` | Set this to `true` if the returned attribute is a composite type. If set to `true`, the keys within the composite type are appended to the type instance. (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the MBean block, but sets the type instance instead. |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of strings` | Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the MBean block, but sets the type instance instead. |
| `attribute` | no | `string` | Sets the name of the attribute to read the value from. You can access the keys of composite types by using a dot to concatenate the key name to the attribute name. For example: “attrib0.key42”. If `table` is set to `true`, path must point to a composite type, otherwise it must point to a numeric type. |
| `attributes` | no | `list of strings` | The plural form of the `attribute` config above. Used to derive multiple metrics from a single MBean. |


## Metrics
