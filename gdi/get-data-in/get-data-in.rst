************************************************************************

.. meta::
   :description: This topic walks you through recommended steps for getting data from each layer of your stack into Splunk Observability Cloud to get meaningful insights about your infrastructure, applications, and real user experiences.

The first step toward full-stack observability using Splunk Observability Cloud is getting data from your infrastructure, applications, and user interfaces into the following products in the suite:

- Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

- Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

- Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM)

- Splunk Log Observer

Here’s a high-level overview of options for getting data from each layer of your stack into the Observability Cloud product best suited to provide insights about your data. This diagram also provides a recommended sequence of steps. Splunk highly recommends that you perform steps 1-8 to get the most out of Observability Cloud.

:strong:`Note`: Performing tasks in this sequence is just a recommendation. You can opt to perform these tasks in a different sequence that better suits your workflow and environment.

  :alt: This diagram shows the recommended steps for getting data from each layer of your stack into the Observability Cloud.

Depending on your observability goals and environment, you can choose to perform only a subset of the steps. For example, this might be the case if you don’t use every Observability Cloud product or don’t want to collect data from every eligible data source.


.. _gdi-per-product:

Per product integration recommendations
============================================

The following table calls out which steps are recommended based on which products you want to use. For example, if you are not yet implementing full-stack observability as described in the diagram above and are using only one product, see the product's column to see which steps are recommended, optional, or not applicable (n/a). For example, if you are using RUM only, perform step 6 only.

Likewise, there are steps that are optional or not applicable based on your environment details. For example:

- If you don't use cloud services, step 1 is not applicable.

- If you don’t want to collect infrastructure application data, step 3 is optional.

- If you don’t use serverless functions, step 5 is not applicable.

- If you don’t need to use the Observability Cloud API to collect custom data, step 8 is optional.

1. Integrate with cloud services to send metrics and logs
===================================================================================

If you are using cloud services for your infrastructure, the first step is to integrate these services with Observability Cloud.

This integration can send:

- Metrics and metadata; such as tags, labels and properties; to Infrastructure Monitoring

- Logs to Log Observer (AWS and GCP)

After you’ve integrated with your cloud services, you can access your data in the following locations:

- View metrics in Infrastructure Monitoring navigators

  .. image:: /_images/infrastructure/ebs-navigator.png
     :width: 100%
     :alt: This screenshot shows the EBS navigator in Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring displaying charts and visualizations of data collected from EBS.

  For more information, see:

    - :ref:`monitor-aws-services`

    - :ref:`monitor-gcp-services`

    - :ref:`monitor-azure-services`

- View metrics in :ref:`built-in dashboards <built-in-dashboards>` for AWS, GCP, and Azure services

- Search for metrics :ref:`using the Metric Finder <metric-finder>`. For the list of metrics provided by a cloud service, see:

    - :ref:`aws-metrics`
    - :ref:`GCP metrics <gcp-metrics>`
    - :ref:`Azure metrics <azure-metrics>`

- Query logs in :ref:`Log Observer <logs-timeline>`, if you chose to ingest logs


Integrate with cloud services to send metrics and logs
--------------------------------------------------------------

- To integrate with Amazon Web Services, use the method that best suits your environment:

    - :ref:`aws-wizardconfig`

    - :ref:`get-configAPI`

    - :ref:`Connect to AWS using Terraform <terraform-config>`

- To integrate with Google Cloud Platform services, use the method that best suits your environment:

    - :ref:`Connect to GCP using the guided setup in Splunk Observability Cloud <get-started-gcp>`

    - :new-page:`Connect to GCP using the Splunk Observability Cloud API <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/integrations/gcp_integration_overview>`

    - :new-page:`Connect to GCP using Terraform <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/gcp_integration>`

- To integrate with Microsoft Azure services, use the method that best suits your environment:

    - :ref:`Connect to Azure using the guided setup in Splunk Observability Cloud <get-started-azure>`

    - :new-page:`Connect to Azure using the Splunk Observability Cloud API <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/integrations/msazure_integration_overview>`

    - :new-page:`Connect to Azure using Terraform <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/azure_integration>`

For example, you might want to use the guided setup if you are setting up just a few integrations, such as five or less. However, if you are setting up many integrations, such as for different accounts and regions, use the API or Terraform. Note that if you need all of the latest integration features, you may want to use the API because support may not yet be available using Terraform.

7. Configure homegrown applications and serverless functions to send custom data
========================================================================================

Now that you have built-in data from your full stack flowing into Observability Cloud, assess whether there are custom data points you need to bring in. You can configure applications to send custom metrics and instrument serverless functions to send custom traces.

For many teams, some of the most meaningful data is custom data because you can define these data points to focus on what is most important to you in your specific environment.

For example, if you run an e-commerce site, you might configure your application to send a custom metric about the number of orders placed. You can then create a detector to receive an alert when the number of orders drops significantly. You might also configure your application to send a custom metric about how long payment processing takes. You can then create a detector to issue alerts when the processing time exceeds a threshold.

This integration can send:

- Custom metrics to Infrastructure Monitoring

- Custom traces to APM

After you’ve configured your homegrown applications and instrumented your serverless functions to send custom metrics and traces, you can access your data in the following locations:

- View traces on the APM landing page to :ref:`assess the health of your applications <apm-landing-page>`

- View traces in the APM Explorer view to :ref:`assess dependencies among your applications <apm-service-map>`

- Search for metrics :ref:`using Metric Finder <metric-finder>`

    .. image:: /_images/gdi/metric-finder.png
      :width: 100%
      :alt: This screenshot shows metric search results in the Metric Finder


Configure homegrown applications to send custom data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the library for your application's language:

- :new-page:`Go client library for SignalFx <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-go>` on GitHub

- For Java, use one of these available integrations:

8. Use the Observability Cloud API to send custom data
========================================================================================

Now that you have built-in data from your full stack flowing into Observability Cloud, assess whether there are custom data points you need to bring in. You can use the Observability Cloud API to bring in custom data.

You might want to use the API if you want to integrate with:

- A third-party tool that provides an API/webhook integration only.

- An application written in a language we don’t provide a library for.

This API integration can send all types of data to Observability Cloud. While you can use the API to send logs to Log Observer, we recommend using other integration types to do so. For details about which integrations can send logs to Log Observer, see :ref:`gdi-per-product`.

After you’ve configured your integration to send custom data, you can access your data in the following locations:

- View traces on the APM landing page to :ref:`assess the health of your applications <apm-landing-page>`

- View traces in the APM Explorer view to :ref:`assess dependencies among your applications <apm-service-map>`

- Search for metrics :ref:`using Metric Finder <metric-finder>`

- Query logs :ref:`using Log Observer <logs-timeline>`, if you chose to ingest logs.
