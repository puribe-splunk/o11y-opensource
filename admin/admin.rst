   :description: Learn how to how to set up and administer your organization.

One of the first steps in getting started with Observability Cloud is setting up your organization. In Observability Cloud, an organization, or account, is the highest-level security grouping. For example, data within an organization cannot be accessed by other organizations and their users.

To set up your organization, create and carry out a plan that addresses key aspects of your organization as covered below. Many of these tasks require administrator permissions and some tasks might need to be performed on an ongoing administrative basis beyond the initial setup.

Here are key aspects of your Observability Cloud organization to plan for and set up:

- Set up authentication that follows your security protocols

    For information, see :ref:`sso-label` and :ref:`allow-services`.

- Invite administrators to help with the setup process

- Create access tokens to authenticate API calls and data ingestion
